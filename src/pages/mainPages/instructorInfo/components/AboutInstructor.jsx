                        <p>One day Vako had enough with the 9-to-5 grind, or more like 9-to-9 in his case, and quit his job, or more like got himself fired from his own startup.</p>
                        <p>He decided to work on his dream: be his own boss, travel the world, only do the work he enjoyed, and make a lot more money in the process. No more begging for vacation days and living from paycheck to paycheck. After trying everything from e-commerce stores to professional poker his lucky break came when he started freelance design. Vako fell in love with the field that gives him the lifestyle of his dreams.</p>
