        desc: `It gives you a huge self-satisfaction when you look at your work and say, "I made this!". I love that feeling after I’m done working on something. When I lean back in my chair, the final result with a smile, and there lies this “spark joy” moment. It’s especially satisfying when I know I just made $5,000.

For example, this is a Design course but I won't teach you Photoshop. Because Photoshop is incredibly complicated for Web Design. But people still teach it to web designers. I don’t. I teach Figma – a simpler tool that’s made specifically for Web Design. You will be designing a complete website within a week while others are still learning how to create basic layouts in Photoshop.`,

He decided to work on his dream: be his own boss, travel the world, only do the work he enjoyed. This decision changed his life completely, and now he helps others achieve the same.`,

                "I appreciate the precise short videos (10 mins or less each) because overly long videos tend to make me lose focus. The instructor is very knowledgeable in Web Design and it shows as he shares his knowledge. These were my best 6 months of training. Thanks, Vako.",
